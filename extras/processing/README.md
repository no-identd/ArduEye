This repository contains a fork of the ArduEyeGUI Processing sketch from [Centeye, Inc](http://www.centeye.com/).
This sketch allows you to visualize the output of the Centeye Stonyman2 vision chip connected to an
Arduino or Arduino-compatible microcontroller.  This GUI currently works with the Arduino sketches in
[GUI](https://github.com/simondlevy/ArduEye/tree/master/examples/Flow) and 
[Flow](https://github.com/simondlevy/ArduEye/tree/master/examples/Flow), which use the 
[GUIClient](https://github.com/simondlevy/ArduEye/blob/master/src/GUIClient.h) 
library to communicate with the Processing sketch.
